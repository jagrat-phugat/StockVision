# StockVision

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical stock market data to build predictive models that assist traders and investors in making informed decisions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Model evaluation and performance comparison.
- Stock price visualization and trend analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `Main.ipynb` notebook.
3. Input stock data and analyze predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Date
- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Trading Volume
- Other relevant financial indicators

## Model Training
The following machine learning models were explored:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series prediction

## Results
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved high accuracy with a minimal error margin.
- **Visualization**: Stock trends were successfully captured, with LSTM providing the best predictive capability.
- **Predicted vs. Actual**: Model closely follows real stock price movements.

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time stock price prediction.
- Use advanced deep learning models (e.g., Transformers for time series forecasting).
- Deploy as a web-based interactive dashboard.
